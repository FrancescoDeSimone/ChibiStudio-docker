*****************************************************************************

*** Next ***
- NEW: Added a "library generator" project for RT, it allows to
       generate a library with a pre-configured RT. It also includes
       an "header generator" able to generate an unified "ch.h" with
       all options resolved.
- LIB: Improved OSLIB initialization.
- NEW: Lots of style fixes thanks to the new tool.
- NEW: Code style checker tool added.
- NEW: Added and embedded flash driver model in HAL. Added an implementation
       for STM32F1xx, STM32L4xx, STM32L4xx+. 
- NEW: Modified AES GCM function signatures.
- HAL: Added H753 to all H7 mcuconf.h files.
- NEW: Added transactional updates to MFS. Doubled data headers magic numbers
       for improved safety and to keep the final write aligned to 64 bits, it
       is required for STM32 ECC flash.
- VAR: Modified syscalls.c to allocate memory from bottom upward, ChibiOS
       allocators take memory from top downward. This way the memory taken
       using _sbrk_r() does not contain "holes" caused by other allocators.
- LIB: Re-introduced missing chGuardedPoolGetCounterI() function to guarded
       pools allocator.
- LIB: Modified core allocator to be able to get blocks starting from bottom
       or top of the available memory range.
       Removed alignment enforcement for requested block size. Alignment is
       only ensured on the returned pointer, this should reduce memory usage
       is some cases.
- HAL: Added a new interface for range-finder devices (used by EX).
- HAL: Added mcuconf.h updater tool for STM32F407 (backported to 19.1.1).
- NIL: Integrated NIL 4.0.

- FIX: Fixed long intervals fail when interval type is larger than time type
       (bug #1031)(backported to 19.1.3)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed Round Robin check missing when in tick-less mode (bug #1030)
       (backported to 19.1.3)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed RCC_AHB1ENR_BKPSRAMEN not present in all STMF4xx devices
       (bug #1029)(backported to 19.1.3)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed MPU fix #1027 broke stack checking on Cortex-M devices without
       MPU (bug #1028)(backported to 19.1.3)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed MPU setup missing on thread start (bug #1027)
       (backported to 19.1.2)(backported to 18.2.3).

       (backported to 19.1.2)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed invalid EXTI registry constant for STM32L4+ (bug #1024)
       (backported to 19.1.2).
- FIX: Fixed missing RTC definitions in STM32L1xx registry (bug #1023)
       (backported to 19.1.2).
- FIX: Fixed missing EXTI driver integration on some platforms (bug #1022)
       (backported to 19.1.2).
- FIX: Fixed various UART clock naming errors in STM32H7 HAL (bug #1021)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed missing STM32L4+ check in GPIOv3 driver (bug #1020)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed call to obsolete dmaStreamRelease() in STM32 I2Cv3 driver
       (bug #1019)(backported to 19.1.1).
- FIX: Fixed misconfiguration in STM32L4R9I DIscovery board files (bug #1018)
       (backported to 19.1.1).
- FIX: Fixed wrong Debug launch configuration in STM32L4Rx demos (bug #1017)

       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed uninitialized variables in STM32 DMA drivers (bug #1010)
       (backported to 19.1.1).

       (bug #1008)(backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed problem in STM32 mcuconf.h template files (bug #1007)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
