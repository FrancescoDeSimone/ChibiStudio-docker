*** Next ***
- NEW: Added transactional updates to MFS.
- VAR: Modified syscalls.c to allocate memory from bottom upward, ChibiOS
       allocators take memory from top downward. This way the memory taken
       using _sbrk_r() does not contain "holes" caused by other allocators.
- LIB: Modified core allocator to be able to get blocks starting from bottom
       or top of the available memory range.
       Removed alignment enforcement for requested block size. Alignment is
       only ensured on the returned pointer, this should reduce memory usage
       is some cases.
- HAL: Added a new interface for range-finder devices (used by EX).
- HAL: Added mcuconf.h updater tool for STM32F407 (backported to 19.1.1).
- NIL: Integrated NIL 4.0.
- FIX: Fixed chTimeIsInRangeX() failing under some configurations (bug #1015)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed invalid AXI errata fix for STM32H7xx (bug #1014)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed invalid ADCD3 initialization in STM32 ADCv3 driver (bug #1013)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed invalid call to dmaStreamRelease() in STM32 SDIOv1 driver
       (bug #1012)(backported to 19.1.1).
- FIX: Fixed wrong license restriction check in Nil (bug #1011)
       (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed uninitialized variables in STM32 DMA drivers (bug #1010)
       (backported to 19.1.1).
- FIX: Fixed wrong mcuconf.h in some testex demos related to STM32F407 
  (bug #1008)(backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- FIX: Fixed problem in STM32 mcuconf.h template files (bug #1007)
  (backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- EX:  Fixed I2C Acquire bus called twice in the HTS221 initialization 
  (bug #1006)(backported to 19.1.1)(backported to 18.2.3).
- EX:  Fixed missing I2C release bus in LPS22HB initialization (bug #1005)
  (backported to 19.1.1).
