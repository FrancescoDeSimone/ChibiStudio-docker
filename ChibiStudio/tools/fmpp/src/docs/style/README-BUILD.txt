You should store all files that are about the visual design here, such as
images that aren't part of the content (i.e, that aren't figures), fonts,
style sheets, and js that controls the UI.

For style sheets use LESS instead of CSS. The *.less files are converted
to CSS by the Ant build according to "gulpfile.js".
