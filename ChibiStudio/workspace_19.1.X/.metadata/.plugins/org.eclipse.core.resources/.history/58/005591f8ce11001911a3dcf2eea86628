*** Releases and Change Log                                               ***
*****************************************************************************

*** Next ***
- CHG: chFifoObjectInit() renamed to chFifoObjectInitAligned(). Added a new
       chFifoObjectInit() without the alignment parameter.
- NEW: Stricter alignment checks in memory pools.
- NEW: Added chvsnprintf().
- NEW: Event enable check API added to PAL driver.
- NEW: Now it is possible to define separate directories for each
       configuration file.
- NEW: Added option to enable bypass on SDIOv1 driver allowing to use a
       50MHz clock.
- NEW: Added TIM15, TIM16 and TIM17 support on GPT, ICU and PWM drivers,
       limited to STM32F3, L4 and L4+ platforms.
- NEW: STM32H7xx and STM32L4+ ports reworked to support dynamic DMA
       allocation. Updated all drivers to use the new DMA API.
- NEW: Both DMAv1 and DMAv2 have been reworked to support DMAMUX, DMAv3 has
       been removed. In addition, both drivers are now able to support dynamic
       channel allocation.
- NEW: The callback of drivers with circular buffers (ADC, DAC, I2S, SPI) has
       been simplified, no parameters. A driver function xxxIsBufferComplete()
       has been added to determine if it is the half buffer callback or the
       final callback.
- NEW: ADC driver state machine change, now the state ADC_COMPLETE is set
       before calling the 2nd callback even in circular mode. This has been
       done for consistency with other drivers with circular buffers.
- NEW: Low level drivers simplification. There is a new template of LLD, now
       driver and configuration types are defined in the HLD, LLD just exports
       macros with the fields to be added to the structures.
       So far the drivers updated are: ADC, DAC, I2S, RTC, SPI, TRNG, WSPI.
- NEW: Added UART7/8 support to STM32 UART USARTv1 driver.
- NEW: Added persistent storage interface to the STM32 RTCv2 driver.
- NEW: STM32 RTCv2 driver now supports callbacks on events.
- NEW: Added an EXTI helper driver for STM32.
- NEW: Added demo for STM32L4R9I-Discovery board.
- NEW: Support for new serial NOR device MX25LM51245G. Other Macronix devices
       should work but not tested.
- NEW: Serial NOR flash infrastructure reworked and made simpler.
- NEW_ Modified the RTC driver to implement the persistent storage interface
       instead of files interface.
- NEW: Added a new "persistent storage" base class to HAL.
- NEW: Added support for TIM21 and TIM22 in STM32 GPT driver.
- NEW: Reinforced checks in TIM-related drivers.
- NEW: Added support for STM32L072 and STM32L073.
- NEW: Added chThdResume() function to NIL.
- NEW: Removed QSPI driver model, entirely replaced by WSPI.
- NEW: Added demos regarding WSPI, serial nor driver and MFS.
- NEW: Modified the serial nor driver to work with WSPI instead of QSPI,
       improved it in several way, simplicity mainly.
- NEW: Added an STM32 QUADSPIv1 implementation for WSPI.
- NEW: Added a new WSPI driver model to HAL, it is a redesign of the
       existing QSPI for generic "Wide SPI" interfaces. It now supports up
       to eight data lines so "quad" was no more appropriate.
- NEW: Added a new SIO driver model to HAL, it is a low level abstraction of
       an UART.
- NEW: Added separate "load key" functions for each algorithm in the CRY
       driver. Each "engine" is supposed to have its own transient key.
- NEW: Removed TRNG functionality from CRY driver, it is a separate thing now.
- NEW: Independent TRNG driver model added to HAL. Implemented a RNGv1 driver
       for STM32, added test application.
- NEW: Added a new "pipes" subsystem to the OS library.
- NEW: Added mcuconf.h generators for STM32L432xx, STM32L476xx, STM32L496xx,
       STM32L4Rxxx, STM32F72x/73x, STM32F746/756, STM32F76x/77x, STM32F413xx
       and STM32F303xx devices.
- NEW: Added demo for STM32L496ZG-Nucleo144 and STM32L4R5ZI-Nucleo144 boards.
- NEW: Modified USARTv2 to support HW FIFOs where present.
- NEW: STM32 DMAv1, ADCv3, DACv1, I2Cv2, SPIv2 and USARTv2 are now
       DMAMUX-aware.
- NEW: Introduced support for STM32L4+ devices.
- NEW: TRNG API now takes a new "size" parameter, the API can now generate
       random numbers of variable size. The crypto driver now does not store
       a copy of the transient key inside, the low level can do that if
       required.
- NEW: Added analog watchdog functionality to STM32 ADCv2 driver.
- NEW: Added a termination check to the shell.
- NEW: Updated CMSIS to version 5.4.0.
- NEW: Now chconf.h files have preprocessor checks around each definition,
       this allows to override settings from makefiles.
- NEW: Added new functions to I/O queues: qSetLink()(backported to 18.2.2).
- NEW: Added new functions to objects fifos: chFifoReturnObjectS()(backported
       to 18.2.2),
       chFifoSendObjectAheadI(), chFifoSendObjectAheadS() and
       chFifoSendObjectAhead()(backported to 18.2.2).
- NEW: Added new functions to guarded pools: chGuardedPoolFreeS() and
       chGuardedPoolAddS().
- NEW: Added initializer sections for flash0...flash7 memory areas in
       GCC Cortex-M linker scripts.
- NEW: Added support for oversampling in STM32 ADCv3 driver.
- NEW: Restructured the STM32F4xx HAL support, added support for STM32F413,
       added ability to handle the TIMPRE bit, separated the clock tree in
       two distinct implementation to reduce the proliferation of compiler
       time conditionals, added more checks to the input parameters.
- NEW: Added optional support for character match callback in the UART
       high level driver.
- NEW: Change, chMtxGetNextMutexS() renamed to chMtxGetNextMutexX().
- NEW: RT C++ wrapper reworked, now it is mostly inline code, added some new
       wrappers and methods. Added wrappers for more API functions. BaseThreads
       are no more descendants of ThreadReference.
- NEW: Updated STM32L4xx headers to version 1.11.0.
- NEW: Added HAL support for STM32L443.
- NEW: Added support for LDM303AGR 6 axis Accelerometer\Magnetometer MEMS.
- NEW: Added support for LSM6DSL 6 axis Accelerometer\Gyroscope MEMS.
- NEW: Added support for LPS22HB 2 axis Barometer\Thermometer MEMS.
- NEW: Separated OSLIB from RT and NIL, now it is a separate "product" with
       its own version, configuration file and licensing. The library will
       grow to include more functionalities.
       RT and NIL will contain only the core functionalities, everything else
       is shared library code.
